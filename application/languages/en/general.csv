bc auth index page description;Bigcommerce has developed a new authentication mechanism for apps. That's why there is no need to use a standalone page to log in to this app anymore. You need to install the app in administrator's panel of your store in <b>APPS</b> section, which is displayed as a badge in the left side of the screen. If you have earlier been registered in our app using an old authentication method, then you need to reinstall the app. Data with statistics won't be lost if administrator's email is the same as it was indicated when registering of the app. If an e-mail in the app and e-mail of your store's administrator are different, so before reinstalling the app, in order to save statistics contact us by <a href="mailto:contact@spur-i-t.com">contact@spur-i-t.com</a> and write e-mail of your store's administrator and e-mail that was indicated earlier when registering of the app.
